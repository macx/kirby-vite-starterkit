My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?<\/p><p>I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Look, you gotta listen to me.

About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Watch it, Goldie. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.<\/p>"},"id":"8239922c-301b-4c30-9a9f-2ab5aaa5bf9e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
